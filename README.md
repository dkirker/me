What would be the equivalent of my source code. :P

This will host miscellaneous files for working on projects I am doing. This is also a place to host a small wiki for all of my technical projects (since I come up with great ones, and immediately forget what they were. :( ).

	Feel free to clone, edit, and make pull requests!
